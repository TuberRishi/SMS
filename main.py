about_content = """# About Us \n Welcome to our innovative project, the "Stock Market Screener" â€“ a tool designed to empower investors and traders with the ability to filter and select stocks based on specific criteria, helping them make informed investment decisions. This project is a culmination of our dedication and hard work in pursuit of our Diploma in Computer Engineering, presented to the prestigious Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education, Mumbai.

## Our Journey\n
The journey of developing the "Stock Market Screener" began in the academic year 2023-2024, under the roof of the Government Polytechnic Arvi Dist.-Wardha, a renowned institution known for fostering innovation and technical excellence. This project is not just a requirement for our diploma; it's a reflection of our passion for combining the fields of computer engineering and finance to create tools that can significantly impact the way financial markets are analyzed.

## The Team\n
Our team is a trio of dedicated and enthusiastic computer engineering students, each bringing a unique set of skills and perspectives to the project:

##### Rushikesh Burankar (2101320111)

##### Tejas Tikkas (2101320097)

##### Sanket Nasare (2101320100)

## Guided by Excellence\n
The project was brought to fruition under the expert guidance of 
#####    Mr. S.U. Rathod Sir
a distinguished lecturer in the Department of Computer Engineering. His mentorship has been invaluable, providing us with the insights and encouragement needed to navigate the challenges of developing a sophisticated financial tool.

## Our Vision\n
The "Stock Market Screener" is more than just a project for us; it's a step towards democratizing financial information and tools, making them accessible to everyone. We believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and through this project, we aim to contribute to the financial well-being of individuals around the globe.

## Connect with Us \n
We are always looking to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and financial experts. Whether you're interested in learning more about our project, sharing feedback, or discussing potential collaborations, feel free to reach out.

Thank you for visiting our website. We are excited to embark on this journey with you, exploring the vast possibilities of the stock market with the help of our Stock Market Screener.
